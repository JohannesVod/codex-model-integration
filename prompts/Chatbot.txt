 solution:<p><strong>First,</strong> To use <code>await</code> you should declare the function as <code>async</code>. You have done so with the outer function but not with the inner function.</p>

<p>The change will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>bookmarksIDs.forEach(async bookmarkID =&gt; {

There are some problems with using async/await in a forEach loop. The main problem is that the forEach method is not async-aware, which means that it does not wait for the resolution of the promises returned by the async callbacks(see). This means that the loop is not executed in the correct order and you cannot wait for the loop to end. Also, you cannot implement error handling or termination conditions for the loop.
To avoid these problems, there are some alternatives you can use to use async/await with a loop. One way is to use a for-of loop that is async-aware and allows you to wait for each element of the loop21. Another way is to use the Promise.all() method with the array.map() method, which executes all the Promises in an array in parallel and returns a new array with the results. This method is faster than the for-of loop, but it requires that you create all the Promises in advance and that you handle all errors in a single catch block.
Here is an example of how you can use these alternatives to improve your function:

// using a for-of loop
async function printFiles () {
  const files = await getFilePaths() // Assume this works fine

  // use a for-of loop to iterate over the files array
  for (let file of files) {
    // use await to wait for the file contents
    const contents = await fs.readFile(file, 'utf8')
    console.log(contents)
  }
}

printFiles()

title: How does Python sort a list of tuples?

link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/644170/how-does-python-sort-a-list-of-tuples

 solution:<p>It automatically sorts a list of tuples by the first elements in the tuples, then by the second elements and so on tuple([1,2,3]) will go before tuple([1,2,4]). If you want to override this behaviour pass a callable as the second argument to the sort method. This callable should return 1, -1, 0.<

l = [(4, "Haus"), (10, "Banane"), (3, "Apfel"), (2, "Meise"), (1, "Kuchen")]

# How can i sort this list by the first element of the tuples: [(1, "Kuchen"), (2, "Meise"), (3, "Apfel"), (4, "Haus"), (10, "Banane")]

Here you can just use the sort() function over the list. In your case you can call l.sort() (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/644170/how-does-python-sort-a-list-of-tuples)
